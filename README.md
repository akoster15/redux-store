## About

On this website, you are able to scroll through products and add them to your cart and checkout, as you would on an actual e-commerce website. 
Using graphql and MongoDB this website stores your products in a database, and uses different queries and mutations for website functionality.

## User Story

```md
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```
