## About

On this website, you are able to scroll through products and add them to your cart and checkout, as you would on an actual e-commerce website. 
Using graphql and MongoDB this website stores your products in a database, and uses different queries and mutations for website functionality.

## User Story

SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```
